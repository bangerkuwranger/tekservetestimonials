Wordpress plugin to create a custom post type for Testimonials. Includes custom fields for name and organization of the quote source.

== Description ==

It's easy to create simple custom post types, and create functional dependencies in your theme while doing so. Skip it! Use this plugin to create a theme-independent custom post type for your site to maintain a collection of testimonials. We use it for storing all of our awesome customers' feedback in on our site, but you can store and call any type of quotations in your site with this plugin. Easy.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `tekservetestimonials` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Start creating your collection of quotes in the 'Quotes and Testimonials' item in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I show my quotes on a page? =

Right now, we are using a theme modification to do this; it's pretty easy to call custom post types in the loop, and you can display a single post with some code for a custom shortcode. I'll be updating the plugin to provide a shortcode for either a random or specific quote as a clean html element to use in pages and posts soon.

= Can I display a section with rotating quotes? =

Sure! You'll have to write the rotator, and you can set up an admin panel to select the quotes, or just use shortcode attributes. However, there are already many existing plugins that already provide this function, and that may be easier for you to implement. This was written to provide a lightweight implementation of a specific function: to enter, store, and display a single quote at a time.
